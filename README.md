#  Coin Flip - A simple coin flip app

This is a simple HTML app that uses Javascript for both state management and also game logic. This mini-game was built during the 90 minute tutoring session with Unlock Academy from July 27, 2020. The `lite` branch is the original work from that session. Everything in this branch is a slightly cleaner version of that work.

There will be an evolved version of this TBD.

## The Game
There are four states to the game:
- Game Start
  - Allows the user to decide if they'd like to play
- Affirmative Game Play Confirmation
  - Displays a heads and tails button to allow the user to make their selection
  - Displays a flip coin button to display the results
- Negative Game Play Confirmation
  - Displays a message to the user acknowledging their choice
  - Displays another button to invite the user to play if they change their mind
- Game Results
  - Displays the user's choice
  - Displays the result of the coin flip
  - Displays whether or not the user won or lost
  - Invites the user to play again
