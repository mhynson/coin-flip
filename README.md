#  Coin Flip - A simple coin flip app

This is a simple HTML app that uses Javascript for both state management and also game logic. This mini-game was built during the 90 minute tutoring session with Unlock Academy from July 27, 2020. The `lite` branch is the original work from that session. Everything in this branch is a slightly cleaner version of that work.

There will be an evolved version of this TBD.

## The Game
There are four states to the game:
- Game Start
  - Allows the user to decide if they'd like to play
- Affirmative Game Play Confirmation
  - Displays a heads and tails button to allow the user to make their selection
  - Displays a flip coin button to display the results
- Negative Game Play Confirmation
  - Displays a message to the user acknowledging their choice
  - Displays another button to invite the user to play if they change their mind
- Game Results
  - Displays the user's choice
  - Displays the result of the coin flip
  - Displays whether or not the user won or lost
  - Invites the user to play again

## Things to consider
I'm not going to worry about polishing this app within this repository, especially for the purpose of demoing some code and possibilities for students.

There's plenty of polish needed though. Some critical improvements would be to:
- add a selected state for the user's coin choice
- show some sort of coin animation
- more visual appeal
